In Scala, the `private[scala]` access modifier is used to restrict the visibility of a class, trait, object, or member to the `scala` package. This means that the entity marked with `private[scala]` can only be accessed from within the `scala` package or its sub-packages.

### Example:

```scala
package scala {
  package example {
    class MyClass {
      private[scala] def myMethod(): Unit = {
        println("This method is accessible within the scala package.")
      }
    }
  }

  package other {
    class AnotherClass {
      def testAccess(): Unit = {
        val obj = new example.MyClass()
        obj.myMethod()  // This will compile because we are within the scala package.
      }
    }
  }
}

package outside {
  class OutsideClass {
    def testAccess(): Unit = {
      val obj = new scala.example.MyClass()
      // obj.myMethod()  // This would not compile because we are outside the scala package.
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`private[scala]`**: The method `myMethod` is accessible only within the `scala` package. This includes any sub-packages of `scala`.
- **Access within `scala` package**: In the `scala.other.AnotherClass`, the method `myMethod` can be accessed because it is within the `scala` package.
- **Access outside `scala` package**: In the `outside.OutsideClass`, the method `myMethod` cannot be accessed because it is outside the `scala` package.

This kind of access control is useful when you want to expose certain functionality only to a specific package or set of packages, while keeping it hidden from the rest of the codebase.
